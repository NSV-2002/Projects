      <p><b>Robert John Downey Jr. </b>(born April 4, 1965)[1] is an American actor. His career has been characterized <br>
       by critical success in his youth, followed by a period of substance abuse and legal troubles, and a surge<br>
        in popular and commercial success later in his career. His films as a leading actor have grossed over $14<br> 
        billion worldwide, making him one of the highest-grossing actors of all time.[2] In 2008, Downey was named<br> 
        by Time magazine among the 100 most influential people in the world, and from 2013 to 2015, he was <br>
       listed by Forbes as Hollywood's highest-paid actor.[3][4]</p>
    <p>  At the age of five, he made his acting debut in his father Robert Downey Sr.'s film Pound in 1970. He<br>
         subsequently worked with the Brat Pack in the teen films Weird Science (1985) and Less than Zero (1987). <br>
         In 1992, Downey portrayed Charlie Chaplin in the biopic Chaplin, for which he was nominated for the Academy<br>
          Award for Best Actor and won a BAFTA Award. Following a stint at the Corcoran Substance Abuse Treatment Facility<br>
           on drug charges, he joined the TV series Ally McBeal, for which he won a Golden Globe Award. He was fired <br>
           from the show in the wake of drug charges in 2000 and 2001. He stayed in a court-ordered drug treatment program<br>
            and has maintained his sobriety since 2003.  </p>
